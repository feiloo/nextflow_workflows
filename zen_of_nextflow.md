# Conventions for good Nextflow code

these are my conventions for writing good nextflow code
they are loosely inspired by the zen of python and build on my practical experience from writing nextflow pipelines.

those apply to code, documentation and data

## In order of priority, with highest priority first:

simplicity > performance
simplicity > verbosity

dont use style code or outputs
good style comes through form follows function

keep high coupled interactions local (code and data-wise)

dont repeat yourself
but repeat yourself if it avoids alot of complexity

optimize late
when optimizing, optimize separately and at a lower level

explicit > implicit
flat > nested

fail fast and hard
check inputs where the inputs are used

if you need to check inputs earlier, scan the input checks and generate a checker (in other words, dont use hardcoded checks as late as necessary)
therefore fail where the error occurs, as this improves debugging alot

functional immutable stateless > inplace stateful

use types for correctness > unittesting first > runtime validation

hackable code > extendable code > plugins > configuration
