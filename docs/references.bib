	abstract = {DNA variation analysis has become indispensable in many aspects of modern biomedicine, most prominently in the comparison of normal and tumor samples. Thousands of samples are collected in local sequencing efforts and public databases requiring highly scalable, portable, and automated workflows for streamlined processing. Here, we present nf-core/sarek 3, a well-established, comprehensive variant calling and annotation pipeline for germline and somatic samples. It is suitable for any genome with a known reference. We present a full rewrite of the original pipeline showing a significant reduction of storage requirements by using the CRAM format and runtime by increasing intra-sample parallelization. Both are leading to a 70\% cost reduction in commercial clouds enabling users to do large-scale and cross-platform data analysis while keeping costs and CO2 emissions low.

  abstract  = {Recent advances in sequencing technology make it possible to comprehensively catalog genetic variation in population samples, creating a foundation for understanding human disease, ancestry and evolution. The amounts of raw data produced are prodigious, and many computational steps are required to translate this output into high-quality variant calls. We present a unified analytic framework to discover and genotype variation among multiple samples simultaneously that achieves sensitive and specific results across five sequencing technologies and three distinct, canonical experimental designs. Our process includes (i) initial read mapping; (ii) local realignment around indels; (iii) base quality score recalibration; (iv) SNP discovery and genotyping to find all potential variants; and (v) machine learning to separate true segregating variation from machine artifacts common to next-generation sequencing technologies. We here discuss the application of these tools, instantiated in the Genome Analysis Toolkit, to deep whole-genome, whole-exome capture and multi-sample low-pass (~4×) 1000 Genomes Project datasets.}

abstract = {Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a key biomarker for cancer therapy and prognosis. Traditional experimental assays are laborious and time-consuming, and next-generation sequencing-based computational methods do not work on leukemia samples, paraffin-embedded samples, or patient-derived xenografts/organoids, due to the requirement of matched normal samples. Herein, we developed MSIsensor-pro, an open-source single sample MSI scoring method for research and clinical applications. MSIsensor-pro introduces a multinomial distribution model to quantify polymerase slippages for each tumor sample and a discriminative site selection method to enable MSI detection without matched normal samples. We demonstrate that MSIsensor-pro is an ultrafast, accurate, and robust MSI calling method. Using samples with various sequencing depths and tumor purities, MSIsensor-pro significantly outperformed the current leading methods in both accuracy and computational cost. MSIsensor-pro is available at https://github.com/xjtu-omics/msisensor-pro and free for non-commercial use, while a commercial license is provided upon request.}

As its first major update, fastp 1.0 will be formally presented in this paper, including its new features and the implementation principles behind it. Two other popular FASTQ preprocessors, Trimmomatic and Cutadapt, will be compared to demonstrate the great advantages of fastp in terms of simplicity, efficiency, and versatility. Some modules, such as the batch processing scripts, will be introduced on how to apply fastp to process FASTQ files efficiently. Additionally, some software design principles will be highlighted to showcase how to develop a successful bioinformatics software.},
